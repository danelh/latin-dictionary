## ToDo (in the distant future)

The work is finished, I could only regret the method I chose to lemmatize keys, which now prevents me producing good j-spelling variant of the dictionary. Though it's possible, but requires several days of handy work, and I think could find them better application working on another dictionaries.

* [ ] fix lemmatizing process for "j"-spelling
* [ ] develop smarter algorithm for authors detection
