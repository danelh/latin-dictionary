# Diccionario auxiliar Español-Latín, Del Col (2007)

Here are source files of the dictionary. If you are looking for the release, see [official site][1].

## Source file mark-up and content notes

Besides two main languages, Spanish and Latin, the dictionary contains words from several other languages, such as Italian, French, German, and English. The complete set of the characters used in the text:

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ÁÉÍàáâçèéêëìíîïñóôúûüýāăēĕīĭōŏūŭǐǒў
0123456789
¡!¿?%()+,-./:;<=>ªº«»–‘’“”…
```

Five characters `*_@#~` are used exclusively for mark-up.

Asterisk symbol (*) marks Spanish headwords and two keywords, "Syn:" and "Uso:".

The at sign (@) marks headwords from other languages ("keyboard", "spaghetti", "würstel") or abbreviations ("URL", "S.O.S.").

Underscore (_) is used for italic text. Virtually always these are Spanish words, but also Latin "vel".

Abbreviations, such as "f" for feminine gender or "Arq" for architecture terms, are being marked with hash sign (#), but this processes is not finished yet.

The tilde (~) is rare and used as a placeholder for the headword. Original text uses dash "-" in this function. Currently placeholders are marked in an unorganized way and should be processes with care. See article "esconder" (se ábdere) for ambiguous case.
