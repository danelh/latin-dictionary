# Latinská Synonymika

**Latin-Czech** dictionary of Latin synonyms. It is a compilation of well-known dictionaries (see [author's preface][1]) translated into Czech language, so some articles could be very familiar, such as [#8][2] _Āfer, Āfricus, Āfricanus_ was repeated in many dictionaries of that time. However explanations are clear, compact, and accompanied with good examples.

_Work in progress._
