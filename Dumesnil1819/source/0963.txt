The horses put nearest the pole of a coach were called +Equi jugales+; and those placed on the sides were called +Equi funales+. That which was at the right hand side was called +Dexterior funalis+; and that at the left, +Sinisterior funalis+: it must be understood of horses placed 
all abreast.
* Sinisteriori funali equo Tiberius, dexteriori Marcellus. #Suet.#
* Jugales equi in medio; funales ab utroque latere. #G. D.#
