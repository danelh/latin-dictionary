# Latin synonyms, Dumesnil (1819)

Full title is "Latin synonyms, with their different significations, and examples taken from the best Latin authors".

Dictionary of **Latin** synonyms with explanations on **English**, in XDXF format.

It is not a real transcript, but only index of keywords. In place of the dictionary articles are links to the corresponding scanned pages in the Internet.

## Sources

This dictionary bases on the English edition of the Dumesnil's book published in 1819:
    
1. Gardin-Dumesnil, J. B.; Gosset, J. M. (translator). _Latin synonyms, with their different significations, and examples taken from the best Latin authors._ Whittaker, London, 1819. URL: <https://archive.org/details/latinsynonymswit00garduoft> \[Accessed 27 March 2019\].


## States and limitations

The edition of the dictionary was chosen because of its availability on Archive.org. There are later publications adding new groups of synonyms and fixing misprints, so this decision is not final.

Originally, this work was only an experiment on producing index of scanned pages from OCR text with possibly high level of errors. In spite of my low expectations, about 80% of the dictionary structure was recognized correctly (garbage characters still could present) and the result can practically be used.

I am going to continue fixing this index, but have no plans on transcribing full text of the articles.

XDXF dictionary contains links to the digital copies on third-party resources, such as Google Books or HathiTrust, with possibly different license politics. However, it should not apply additional limitations, so my work is not in copyright (Public Domain).
