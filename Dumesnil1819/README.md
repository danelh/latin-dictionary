## Usage guidelines

Attached styles [article-style.css](article-style.css) are optional but strongly recommended to the users of GoldenDict. See application's [FAQ][1] for setting up.


## States and limitations

Originally, this work was only an experiment on producing index of scanned pages from OCR text with possibly high level of errors. In spite of my low expectations, about 80% of the dictionary structure was recognized correctly (garbage characters still could present) and the result can practically be used.

I am going to continue fixing this index. Text of the articles will be transcribed, but it could take very long time.
