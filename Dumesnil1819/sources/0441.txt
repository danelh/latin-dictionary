The same author says _Rem carmine signo_, though there be but one verse. _Carmen_ is properly said of prose, when written in a prescribed formula or containing maxims expressed in a sententious style, and words consecrated by customs. Pliny calls _carmen_ the prayer by which the Decii devoted themselves to death for their country.

The sayings, sentences, and maxims of philosophers were called _carmina_.

_Versus_ signifies also a rank, row, or series.
* Ille etiam seras in versum distulit ulmos. #Virg.#
* Triplici pubes quam Dardana versu impellunt. #Id.# speaking of a ship with three banks of oars.
+Versiculus+, (_diminutive of_ versus) a short line, a short verse, a versicle.
* Nunc venio ad illum tuæ epistolæ versiculum. #Cic.#
* Scribere versiculos. #Hor.#
