+Fatum+, (_from_ fari, fatus) %fate%. Pagan philosophers called fate a concatenation of secondary causes subordinate the one to the other, that had necessarily its effect. Fate was an allegorical God, holding in his hands the urn wherein the destiny of all men was inclosed. His decrees were irrevocable, and his power so great that all the other gods submitted to it.

* Anile sane et plenum superstitionis fati nomen ipsum. #Cic.#

+Providentia+, (_from_ pro _and_ videre) %Providence%, the supreme wisdom by which God governs all things.
