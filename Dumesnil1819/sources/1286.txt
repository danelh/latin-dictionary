+Imperium+ includes the idea of a vast dominion or territory, composed of several nations that obey the same master.
* Imperium Romanum. #Cic.#
* Imperium Assyriorum. #Just.#
+Regnum+, %a kingdom%, implies the unity of the nation that forms it.
* Regnum Bithyniæ. #Cic.#
We say _Regnum Galliæ_, _Regnum Hispaniæ_, because the division of these countries into provinces, does not prevent them from forming but one people; instead of which we say _Imperium Germaniæ_, _Imperium Russiæ_, because we know the diversity of people and nations that compose them.
