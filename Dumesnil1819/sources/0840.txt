+Dies+, (masculine) is generally said of a fixed day.
We very seldom find in Cicero _dies prima_, _secunda_, &c. but commonly _dies tertius_, _quartus_, &c. It is always of the masculine gender in the plural number. _Dies meus, dies tuus_, have a signification peculiar to themselves, and worthy of notice: the day on which my fever returns, your fever comes again.
* Cura ut valeas; puto enim diem tuum heri fuisse. #Cic.#
+Dies+, (feminine) is said of time, of an indeterminate day.
* Dies longa videtur opus debentibus. #Hor.#
