+Ducere+, to lead, is generally taken in a good sense; and +Ductare+, its frequentative, in a bad one.
* Ducitur uxor, ductatur meretrix. #G. D.#
Likewise _ducere exercitum_ is said of a general who leads his army in good order; but _ductare exercitum_ is to lead an army in confusion.
* Quod L. Sylla exercitum, quem in Asia ductaverat, quo sibi fidum fecerat, contra morem Majorum, luxuriose, nimisque liberaliter habuerat. #Sall.#
* Ipse quasi vitabundus per saltuosa loca et tramites exercitum ductare. #Id.#
Quintilian is, I believe, in the wrong when he finds fault with the above expressions of Sallust. Virgil says, 
_ducente Deo_; it would be improper to say _ductante Deo_. #G. D.#
