+Deficere+, synonymous with +Deesse+, is said of a thing which one has no more, but had formerly, and which has been lost; _Deesse_ only denotes the absence, the want of a thing.
* Paulo ante vacua turbam deficiunt loca. #Ph√¶d.#
* Ne oratio deesset, ne vox viresque deficerent. #Cic.#
* Non ratio, verum argentum deerat. #Ter.#
* Discentes vita deficit. #Cic.#
_Id mihi deficit_ is bad Latin; the accusative is the only case used with _deficit_.
