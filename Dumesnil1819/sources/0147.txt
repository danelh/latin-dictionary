_Agnatus_ is said of %kindred by the fathers side%. _Agnati_, say the lawyers, _qui per virilis sexus agnationem conjuncti sunt, quasi a patre congeniti, velut frater eodem patre natus, filius fratris, &c._
* Jupiter, Juno, reliqui quos fratres inter se et agnatos usurpare atque appellare solemus. #Cic.# Jupiter, Juno, and the other deities were related by Saturn.

* Pro reditu Pompeii multi cognati et affines deprecati sunt. #Cic.#
It is an axiom in law that _agnati_ are _cognati_; but all _cognati_ are not _agnati_. For example, an uncle by the father's side 
is _agnatus_ and _cognatus_; whereas an uncle by the mother's side is _cognatus_ and not _agnatus_, because the mother was not originally one of her husband's family, and was only admitted into it by her marriage.
