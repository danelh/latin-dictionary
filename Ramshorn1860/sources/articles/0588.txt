Sentences or parts of sentences which express consequences or conclusions derived or founded upon preceding notions, and are acknowledged as true, either as necessary conclusions or consequences, or at the same time, according to our judgment, are united to their preceding part of the sentence by the demonstrative particles *Itaque*, *Igitur*, *Ergo*, %hence%, %therefore%, %consequently%, %now%: *Itaque* has reference to the conclusion, as founded in the fact; *Igitur* refers to that which precedes, as absolutely necessary; *Ergo* shows the obligation of conviction that the drawn conclusion is correct:
* Hecuba omnia mala ingerebat, quemquem adspexerat. =Itaque= adeo jure cœpta appellari est Canis. #Plaut.#
* _Staphyla:_ Ligna hic apud nos nulla sunt.<br/>_Coci:_ Sunt asseres?<br/>_Staphyla:_ Sunt pol.<br/>_Coci:_ Sunt =igitur= ligna; ne quæras foris. #Id.#
* Albano non plus animi erat, quam fidei. nec manere =ergo=, nec transire aperte ausus, sensim ad montes succedit. #Liv.#

In demonstrative minor positions, in which a certain state of things is mentioned as a consequence of a reason or cause at which we point by a particle, *Eo* (for +ea re+), and more emphatically *Ideo*, %therefore%, %hence%, points at a course directly influencing, and as the sole cause; *Idcirco*, %on this account%, points at circumstances as causes of a state of things, inasmuch as the moving agency of the same is drawn into particular account; *Propterea*, %therefore%, %on this account%, points at the nearness of such moving causes; *Proinde*, %hence%, %therefore%, points at the proper, correct relation in which the consequence or effect stands to its reason or cause:
* Hoc anno pestilentia fuit. =eo= nihil dignum memoria actum. #Liv.#
* Verres, quod ubique erit pulcherrimum, auferet? =idcirco= nemo superiorum attigit, ut iste tolleret? =ideo= C. Claudius Pulcher retulit, ut C. Verres posset auferre? #Cic.#

* Duces barbarorum pronuntiari jusserunt, illis reservari, quæcunque Romani reliquissent: =proinde= omnia in victoria posita existimarent. #Cæs.#

In active minor positions, which contain a consequence or effect and refer this back to a reason given in the antecedent, the following relative particles are used: *Quare*, %on which account%, %by%, %through which%, if the given reason is to be considered the means or as existing secondary circumstance; *Quamobrem*, %on which account%, if the given reason is meant to be taken as a general motive; *Quapropter*, %on account of which%, if this reason is to be considered as a near motive, lying close at hand; *Quocirca*, %on which account%, %why%, if the effective agent is to be indicated as lying in the circumstances, which are given as reason:
* Alcibiades et potentior et major, quam privatus, existimabatur. =Quare= fiebat, ut omnium oculos ad se converteret. #Nep.#
* Tuas epistolas quum lego, emergit rursum dolor. =Quamobrem= obsecro te, mi Tite, eripe mihi hunc dolorem aut minue saltem. #Cic.#
